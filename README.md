# Acoustic_Distance_Detector
The goal of the project is to develop a user-friendly smartphone application that can accurately map the walls in indoor spaces. The basic algorithm we will use in this project is Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW). We will use the speaker from the tablet to transmit a periodic chirp and use its microphone to receive the reflected chirp simultaneously.
